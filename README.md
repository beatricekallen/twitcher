#Twitcher

Twitcher is a website that allows birdwatching aficionados to collab online. Users can view upcoming events, resources for new birders, and a members-only blog where people can write about their birding experiences. The Bird of The Day feature on the homepage displays a new bird each day using API calls.

Built with JavaScript, HTML, Materialize CSS, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, Nodemailer, Handlebars, eBird API, and bcrypt.
